## Work from the book 'Eloquent JavaScript', the 3rd Edition, by Marijn Haverbeke

#### This repository hosts all the exercises I completed while reading 'Eloquent JavaScript'. You can find the book here: https://eloquentjavascript.net.

#### While it is a creative and well put together book, I grew a little bored with the content and exercises being so heavily focused on video games / graphics and thus put it down around chapter 16. Also, around the same time, I began taking Frontend Masters courses and generally being obsessed about learning FP. So, it was a mix of personal preference + other interests that led me to not finishing the book. There's a good chance though that you'll love it & won't be able to put it down like I did! So give it a shot.
